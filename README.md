# LDG Tuner Control

## Description

This program (when finished) will control several aspects of the LDG AT-1000ProII and AT-600ProII automatic tuners, including antenna switching, automatic or manual tuning, bypassing the tuner, and of course, executing a tuning operation when a small amount of RF power is applied.

The reason for this program's existence is that LDG offers a Windows executable for controlling the tuner, but has nothing similar available for Linux or any other operating system. Some amateur radio operators (myself included) use Linux primarily in the shack, so now we don't have to resort to running Wine or some other stopgap solution.

This program is built on C++ using Qt. It is hoped that it will eventually run on most flavors of Linux and *BSD. It is mainly developed on a FreeBSD system, but tested on FreeBSD and Linux.


## Hardware

Aside from the tuner itself, an FTDI interface cable is required. Details can be found in this PDF file on LDG's website: [USB Tuner Cable Info](https://ldgelectronics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/USB-Tuner-Cable-Info.pdf)
